	                <h2>Can I actually buy stocks on this website?</h2>
	                <p>Unfortunately not. This website is a group project for CSCE 315 at Texas A&M University. But, the <a href = "quotes.html">Quotes page</a> and the <a href = "index.html">Home page</a> both contain real information that could be very useful.  This site is supposed to imitate the basics of a stock trading company, by using the APIs of three other sites (Yahoo Finance, Twitter, and exchangerate-api.com).</p>
	                <p>&nbsp;</p>
					
					<h2>How do I use My Portfolio?</h2>
	                <p>If you're just starting off the first thing you should do is add some capital to your account (Edit Capital)! You can put in as much money as you'd like, so go nuts! Then, go to Buy/Sell to buy whatever stocks you'd like.  And when selling, don't forget that you have to own some of that stock first!<br /><br />You can also edit your watch list, view your current portfolio, and view your entire color-coded history with us!</p>
	                <p>&nbsp;</p>
	                
	                <h2>When I enter a stock symbol on the Quotes page, I get "Invalid" and a blank chart.</h2>
	                <p>First of all, make sure the symbol you are using is a valid stock symbol in the US markets. If it is still isn't displaying, Yahoo Finance may not have information for that company.</p>
	                <p>&nbsp;</p>
	                
	                <h2>Why aren't any tweets displaying on Quotes and Index?</h2>
	                <p>Twitter search has probably exceeded its allocated bandwidth.  Wait a few minutes and try again. If tweets aren't displaying for a given company (especially obscure ones) on the Quote page, it probably hasn't been tweeted about recently.</p>
